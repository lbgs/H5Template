 1. Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The plugin Calendar will show a small month view and will highlight all
days with events or birthdays. A short information about the event or the
birthday will be shown on mouseover. There is also a link to the defailed
view of an event.

Calendar is a plugin of the online membership management
Admidio (https://www.admidio.org) and can not be used without this.


 2. Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please take a look at our Wiki for a detailed description how to integrate
a plugin to your Admidio installation:
https://www.admidio.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:2.0:plugins

Please don't forget to add the calendar.css to the head of your html page.


 3. Update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To update this plugin you should only replace the calendar.php
and the languages folder.

If there are new settings within the new version and you would like to
use a different value for this setting than the default you must add
this new setting to your existing config.php of this plugin.


 4. Bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you found an issue with this plugin you can report this at our
plugin forum:
https://forum.admidio.org/viewforum.php?f=10

It is also possible to report an issue directly in our issue tracker at
GitHub. There, however, it should be ensured that this is not a
configuration issue, but in fact an error of the plugin.
